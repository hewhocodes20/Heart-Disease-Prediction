# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This Python-based project uses machine learning to predict heart disease risk from clinical data like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. It applies supervised learning with Scikit-learn, and evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC to support early diagnosis.
